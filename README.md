# 📊 Exploring and Visualizing a Dataset

Welcome to the **Exploring and Visualizing a Dataset** project! In this repository, we delve into the world of data exploration and visualization using Python. The goal is to choose a dataset of interest and employ popular Python libraries to extract meaningful insights and present them visually.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:

1. **Dataset Selection**: Choose a dataset that intrigues you. Some examples include weather data, movie ratings, or sports statistics.
2. **Data Exploration**: Utilize Python libraries like Pandas to explore the dataset, perform data cleaning, and understand its structure.
3. **Data Visualization**: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create various types of plots (line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, etc.) to gain insights and present data visually.

## 📚 Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: For making statistical graphics built on top of Matplotlib.

## 📈 Types of Plots

Here are some of the plots you will create:

- **Line Plots**: To show trends over time.
- **Bar Plots**: To compare quantities among different groups.
- **Scatter Plots**: To observe relationships between variables.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sridharchinthaparthi/TAI-IP-Data-Science/exploring-visualizing-dataset.git
    cd exploring-visualizing-dataset
    ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the `exploration_visualization.ipynb` notebook to start exploring and visualizing the dataset.
